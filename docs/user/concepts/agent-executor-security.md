# Agent Executor Security Model

This document explains how the agent executor authenticates and authorizes callers, and how to configure and harden it in production.

## Overview

The **agent executor** is the service that runs agent steps for workflows. Workflow runner Jobs call it over HTTPS via `POST /api/exec/{namespace}/{agentName}` to execute agent tools. Only trusted identities—the OttoFlow controller and runner ServiceAccounts—should be able to call this service.

Authorization is **RBAC-based**: the executor allows any identity that has a specific Kubernetes permission, checked via **SubjectAccessReview** (SAR). There is no allowlist of ServiceAccount names; who can call is determined entirely by ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings.

## How Authentication Works

Every request to the agent executor (except health checks) must include a **Bearer token** (the caller’s ServiceAccount token). The executor then:

1. **Validates the token** using the Kubernetes **TokenReview** API. This proves the token is valid and returns the identity (e.g. `system:serviceaccount:namespace:name`).
2. **Checks authorization** using **SubjectAccessReview**: “Can this identity `get` the ConfigMap `agent-executor-caller` in namespace N?” (N is configurable, typically the release namespace.) Only identities that have been granted this permission via a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings are allowed.

So: **authentication** is “who are you?” (TokenReview), and **authorization** is “are you allowed to call the agent executor?” (SAR).

## How It’s Set Up

1. **ClusterRole**  
   A ClusterRole grants a single, narrow permission: `get` on `configmaps` with `resourceNames: ["agent-executor-caller"]`. The ConfigMap does not need to exist; the permission is used only for the SAR check.

2. **ClusterRoleBindings**  
   - The **controller** ServiceAccount is bound to this ClusterRole (so the controller, and runner Jobs in the same namespace, can call the agent executor).
   - For each **runner** ServiceAccount (in every namespace where WorkflowRuns run), the OttoFlow controller automatically creates a ClusterRoleBinding to the same role. So any namespace that can run workflows can also call the agent executor.

3. **Executor behavior**  
   For each request, the executor runs a SubjectAccessReview against the configured namespace. If the identity has the permission, the request is allowed.

## Configuration

| What you control | How |
|------------------|-----|
| Who can call     | ClusterRoleBindings to the agent-executor-caller ClusterRole (controller creates these for runner SAs when `AGENT_EXECUTOR_CALLER_CLUSTER_ROLE` is set). |
| Namespace for SAR | `agentExecutor.callerNamespace` (Helm; default: release namespace) or `-agent-executor-caller-namespace` (flag). |

With default Helm values, the controller receives `AGENT_EXECUTOR_CALLER_CLUSTER_ROLE` and creates the runner→caller bindings automatically.

## Best Practices

### 1. Restrict Runner Permissions

Runner ServiceAccounts need enough permissions to run workflows (resource queries, mutations, MCP, etc.). Follow least privilege: give the runner ClusterRole only the APIs and verbs your workflows need. The agent-executor-caller role is separate and only grants the narrow “get configmap/agent-executor-caller” permission used for the SAR check.

### 2. Use TLS and Restrict Network Access

The agent executor serves HTTPS only. In production:

- Use TLS (the chart can provision certs or use your own secret).
- Use NetworkPolicies to restrict which namespaces or pods can reach the agent executor service. Only the controller and runner Jobs need access.

### 3. Run in a Dedicated Namespace

Install OttoFlow (including the agent executor) in a dedicated namespace (e.g. `ottoflow`). Avoid running it in `default` or alongside untrusted workloads. This simplifies RBAC and network policies.

### 4. Align Caller Namespace with Installation

The executor’s “caller namespace” (used in the SAR check) should match where the agent-executor-caller ClusterRole is intended to be used—typically the release namespace. The chart sets this from the release namespace by default; only override `agentExecutor.callerNamespace` if your installation namespace differs.

### 5. Audit Who Has the Caller Role

Periodically list ClusterRoleBindings that reference the agent-executor-caller ClusterRole. Only the controller and runner SAs should be bound. Remove any bindings that are no longer needed (e.g. after decommissioning a namespace).

### 6. Multi-Tenant or Multi-Namespace Setups

When WorkflowRuns run in multiple namespaces (e.g. per-tenant namespaces), ensure the controller is deployed with `AGENT_EXECUTOR_CALLER_CLUSTER_ROLE` set (the chart does this when the agent executor is enabled). The controller will create the agent-executor-caller binding for each runner SA it creates. No per-namespace configuration is needed in the executor.

### 7. Explicit Runner ServiceAccounts

If a WorkflowRun specifies `spec.execution.job.serviceAccountName`, the controller does not manage that SA’s bindings (it assumes you manage RBAC for that SA). To let that SA call the agent executor, create a ClusterRoleBinding yourself that binds that ServiceAccount to the agent-executor-caller ClusterRole.

### 8. Secure Agent and MCP Configuration

Agent executor security controls **who can call the service**. The **Agent** and **MCPServer** resources and step definitions control what agents and tools can do. Restrict MCP server credentials, LLM API keys, and agent prompts to what each workflow needs. Prefer narrow, step-specific agents and tools over broad access.

### 9. Monitor and Log

Enable logging and metrics for the agent executor. Monitor for 401s (failed auth) and unexpected callers. Use Kubernetes audit logging if you need to trace who was granted or denied access via SAR.
